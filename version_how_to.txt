How to release a new version number

version pattern:  "Major Version"."PCIE Board Version"."Minor Version"


How to new version number:
Increase major version only when there are very big changes in software and / or hardware.
Increase PCIe board version when the PAL version has increased.
Set minor version to 0 when major or PCIe board version have increased.
Increase minor version in every other case when you want to release a new version number.


Describe your changes:
Put a new version chapter in version.txt at the beginning of the file e.g. v3.20.3. Descripe all changes since the last version number there.


Places where the version number has to be changed:
version.h
escam/escam.pro
escam_deb/create_escam_deb.sh
escam_setup/escam_setup.vdproj

To change the version number in escam_setup.vdproj click in the "Solution Explorer" (right top) in Visual Studio on the project escam_setup. Then change "version" in the properties (right bottom). A window appears. Press yes to accept to change the product code.


Optional:
After you committed the verion number change (best practice is to do this in an own commit), tag the commit with its version number e.g.:
git tag v3.20.3

Push the tag to the remote repositories:
git push --tags
git push --tags github
